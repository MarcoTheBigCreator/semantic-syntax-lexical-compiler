# Semantic Syntax Lexical Compiler

July 27, 2023 

This JavaScript compiler uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) libraries and other tools like [Ohm](https://ohmjs.org/) for building parsers, interpreters, compilers, and more. It serves as a simple example of how programming languages and their compilers work. To create a new language, you need a lexical component that defines the meaning of each word, a syntax component that determines the order of words in a sentence, and a semantic component that ensures everything makes sense.

During the quarter, this compiler was built part by part based on a particular language, creating corresponding automata, diagrams, productions, and matrices. Using these documents, this compiler was created.

# How to use it?

### Step 1: Clone the repository:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MarcoTheBigCreator/semantic-syntax-lexical-compiler.git</code></pre>

### Step 2: Install the node modules:
<pre><code>npm i</code></pre>

### Step 3: Run the development script:
<pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>

### Step 4: Experiment on your own:
You can take a look at the example of the grammar, modify the lanaguage and its rules, and adapt it to your needs or ideas.
